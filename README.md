## Description

Horiseon Company preferred a codebase that was more accessible for the screen reader so that it would be more available to all search engines. Horiseon also wanted to add a navigation bar and alt text to images in the event that the page experiences a load error, the reader will still be able to understand what's intended for the webpage.

I learned how to add and edit semantic HTML on a webpage to make the codebase more clear and concise.
